### OLD - toy recurrence --------------------------------------------------

## I thought for a while that I will use recurrence instead of survival
## and have ODX directly predict recurrence, so tried to create some toy data
## because we don't have recurrence data 
## this is no longer needed however, because we are looking at survival
# 
# 
# # the approximate scores calculated are continuous and normalised
# # discretise them into bins to allow for a simple conformal prediction test 
# 
# # ODX_cats <- c("Bin 1", "Bin 2", "Bin 3", "Bin 4", "Bin 5", "Bin 6", "Bin 7", "Bin 8", "Bin 9", "Bin 10")
# clin_TGx$ODX_cat <- cut(clin_TGx$ODX, breaks = 10, labels = FALSE)
# 
# # create toy data based on vital status:
# # recurrence probability, if they are dead we will assume recurrence prob = 1
# clin_TGx <- clin_TGx %>%
#   mutate(vital_status_num = ifelse(vital_status == "Alive", 1, ifelse(vital_status == "Dead", 0, NA)))
# 
# # creating a toy probability that is taken from a uniform distribution if the patient is alive
# # and is 0 if the person is dead
# # could use different distributions, this is just a toy example
# set.seed(123)
# toy_recurrence_prob <- (runif(nrow(clin_TGx), min = -1, max = 1)) * clin_TGx$vital_status_num
# 
# clin_TGx <- cbind(clin_TGx, toy_recurrence_prob)
# 
# # let's only look at the chemo therapy treated patients, as this is what ODX aims at
# chemo_patients <- clin_TGx[grepl("Pharma", clin_TGx$treatment_type), ]
# # 543 remaining

# event_time: either days_to_death for those who died or days_to_last_follow_up
# t_0 is the day of the diagnosis (days_to_diagnosis is 0 for everyone)

# we are then going to look at survival bins
# i) patient has died within >5 years of diagnosis (event_time < 5*365)
# ii) patient has died within 5-10 years of diagnosis (5*365 =< event_time < 10*365)
